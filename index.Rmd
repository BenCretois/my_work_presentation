### An introduction to the subject

* What is **citizen science**?

* How are citizen science data generated?

* We have to differentiate the *observation* and *reporting process*

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/data_gen.png')
```
]

---
### An introduction to the subject

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="500px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/map_biases_cs.png')
```
]

---
### An introduction to the subject

* During the PhD we looked more precisely at the data generation process in hunters and 
the extent of data they are able to collect

* This lead to a first paper:

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="500px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/paper1.png')
```
]


---
### An introduction to the subject

In citizen science the observation process is driven by multiple actors which can be grouped into four broad categories:

* **Where**: ease of accessibility (public transport, distance to roads ...), aesthetic value of the landscape

* **When**: increased numbers of observations in recent years, weekend bias

* **Why**: spending time outdoor, interested in specific species

* **How**: length of time spent in a site, method to detect the species (i.e. visual / sonor)

---
### An introduction to the subject

* Do the biases really matter when making inference about species' ecology?


--


* It depends at which **scale** we are making the inference

* Are the biases important if we wish to infer species' presence in 50x50km grid cell?

* Can we use citizen science observations to infer species' habitat use?

* In a nutshell, the thesis assesses the **potential of citizen science observations** to infer ecological
properties at different scales.

### An introduction to the subject

The notion of scale in ecology:

### Results of this work

### Results of this work


* Intuitively, we can think that **increasingly precise information** about distribution 
is required **to know about the true presence of the species** over the landscape

* At very small grain sizes, it becomes difficult to even confirm the presence/absence
of a species

* This is **especially the case for highly mobile animals** that range over wide areas and
multiple habitat types

--


.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/size_grid.png')
```
]

---
### Results of this work

* At **coarse grain size** (i.e. at county levels), the distribution of the species is very plausible although not detailed.

* Therefore, biases such as distance to trails or distance to roads do not influence this knowledge as there is road network in all counties in Norway

* With **finer grain sizes comes more uncertainty** regarding roe deer distribution and small grain only partially captures the distribution of roe deer in Norway.


---
### Results of this work

Dealing with biases at large scale:

* **Combining dataset**: different dataset carry different biases and the information brought by each dataset will differ as the grain size decreases (CS data vs hunter data vs car-ungulate collisions)

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/papers_tot.png')
```
]

---
### Results of this work

Dealing with biases at small scale:

* **Quantifying and integrating the biases** in CS observations into a statistical model

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="800px"}

# 3 - My role at NINA

### ... and what I can help you with!

# `r emo::ji('stats')`
---
# What I can help you with!

* I have been hired in Miljødata to **give support to research projects** in diverse ways: data management, collection, analysis with statistics and machine learning and visualization

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/ds_workflow.png')
```
]

* Even though my PhD has made me work mainly with terrestrial systems and large mammals, I am **very open to collaborate with very different topics**!

* I can also apply to / be part of research projects 

* I would actually like to continue doing **some research** along with other Miljødata tasks


---
### What I can help you with!

*Statistics, machine learning and quantitative methods:*

* At NTNU We developed a **Quantitative methods** course from scratch for Master students

* For this course, I created a website **in R** that is hosted on **Github**: **https://bencretois.github.io/GEOG3006/**

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/websiteR.png')
```
]

* I have good knowledge of **species distribution** and **occupancy** models

---
### What I can help you with!

*Spatial data analysis:*

* My PhD largely focused on **spatial data analysis**

* *Spatial statistical models*: point processes, CAR models

* *GIS software*: ArcGIS, QGIS and R (yes GIS in R!)

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="500px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/distribung.png')
```
]

---
### What I can help you with

*Image / sound detection and classification:*

* I recently found a strong interest in **deep learning**!

* For instance, applying **Neural networks** to image / sound classification


.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/panda2.png')
```

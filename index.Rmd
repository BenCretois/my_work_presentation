### An introduction to the topic

### An introduction to the topic

* What is **citizen science**?

* How are citizen science data generated?

* We have to differentiate the *observation* and *reporting process*


.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/data_gen.PNG')
```
]

---
### An introduction to the topic

* During the PhD we looked more precisely at the **data generation process in hunters** and 
the extent of data they are able to collect

* This lead to a first paper:

### An introduction to the topic

For citizen science data, the observation process is driven by multiple factors which can be grouped into **four broad categories**:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="800px"}

```

* But do the biases really matter when making inference about species' ecology?

* **It depends at which scale we are making the inference!**

### An introduction to the topic

The notion of scale in ecology:

# 2 - PhD work

### Results

# `r emo::ji('stats')`

---
### Results


* **The lower the resolution, the more information is needed** to infer species' distribution

* At very small grain sizes, it becomes difficult to even confirm the presence/absence
of a species

* This is **especially the case for highly mobile animals** that range over wide areas and
multiple habitat types


.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/size_grid.PNG')
```
]

---
### Results

* At **coarse grain size** (i.e. at county levels), the distribution of the species is very plausible although not detailed.

* Therefore, biases such as distance to trails or distance to roads do not influence this knowledge as there is road network in all counties in Norway

* With **finer grain sizes comes more uncertainty** regarding roe deer distribution and small grain only partially captures the distribution of roe deer in Norway.

* How to deal with very biased data at **large** and **small** scale?

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/inference_cs.PNG')
```
]

---
### Results

Dealing with biases at large scale:

* **Combining dataset**: different dataset carry different biases and the information brought by each dataset will differ as the grain size decreases (CS data vs hunter data vs car-ungulate collisions)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/papers_tot.PNG')
```

---
### Results

Dealing with biases at small scale:

* **Quantifying and integrating the biases** in CS observations into a statistical model

# What is a data scientist?

### Machine learning vs statistics

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/stat_vs_ml.PNG')
```

.center[
**Machine learning is not a fancy name for statistics!**
]

---
# What I can help you with!

* Give support to research projects in diverse ways using **machine learning** and **statistics**

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/ds_workflow.PNG')
```
]

* I am **very open to collaborate with very different topics**!

* I can also apply to / be part of research projects 

* I would actually like to continue doing **some research** along with other Miljødata tasks


---
### Spatial data analysis & statistics:

* My PhD largely focused on **spatial data analysis**

* *Spatial statistical models*: point processes, CAR models

* *GIS software*: ArcGIS, QGIS and R (yes GIS in R!)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="500px"}

* I recently found a strong interest in **deep learning**!

* For instance, applying **Neural networks** to image / sound classification
